Who's tired of going to a site to run lighthouse and wait for the lighthouse information?
Not to mention you have to manually repeat the same process for different pathnames and wait

Now you don't have to do that anymore.

* Pull the code down and run "npm install"
* Simply create a json file for your website, an example would look like "condo-world.json"
* Run the following command in your terminal except replace condo-world.json with your own json file for your website:
    "node audit.js condo-world.json"
* Take a coffee break while it audits your site, and you will see all the html files in your report folder.
