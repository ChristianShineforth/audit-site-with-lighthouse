Who's tired on going to a site and select different pathes and waiting for the site to load the lighthouse information for their site?

Now you don't have to do that anymore.

* Pull the code down and run "npm install"
* Simply create a json file for your website, an example would look like "condo-world.json"
* Run the following command in your terminal except replace condo-world.json with your own json file of your websiste:
    "node audit.js condo-world.json"
* Take a coffee break while it audits your site, and you will see all the html files in your report folder.
